### Day 20: September 19, 2017    

**Today's Progress**:   
1. Today I started with JavaScript30.  

**Thoughts**:     
1. `document.querySelector` returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.  
2. `e.propertyName` returns the name of the CSS property associated with the transition, when a transitionevent occurs. This property is read-only.
