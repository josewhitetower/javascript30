**Today's Progress**:   
1. Today I continued with JavaScript30.  

**Thoughts**:     
1. Variables CSS `:root{--name:value}`.  
2. Access to variable `var(--name)`. 
3. Events `change` `mousemove`.
4. HTMLElement.dataset property allows access, both in reading and writing mode, to all the custom data attributes (data-*) set on the element, either in HTML or in the DOM.

**Thoughts**:     
1. `transform-origin` by defautl 50%, allows to pivot the element at all.  
2. `transform` allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.  
3. `transition` allows you to change property values smoothly (from one value to another), over a given duration. `transition-timing-function` https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp.

**Today's Progress**:   
1. Today I started with JavaScript30.  

**Thoughts**:     
1. `document.querySelector` returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.  
2. `e.propertyName` returns the name of the CSS property associated with the transition, when a transitionevent occurs. This property is read-only.
